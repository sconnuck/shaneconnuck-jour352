   <h2>The Mets won 102 games in 2022. Still, not even their second-best season in franchise history could keep New York from an early postseason exit.</h2>
   <h3>By Shane Connuck | Adapted from The New York Times</h3>
   <p>Change is inevitable in professional sports. Executives, managers and coaches have shelf lives. Players age or reach the end of their contracts. Performances fluctuate. The 2022 Mets, after a 101-win regular season that seemed to renew hope about a franchise that was often the butt of jokes, will deal with turnover acutely this winter.</p>
   <p>The list of key players who are eligible to become free agents — or might join them if the options in their contracts are not picked up — is long. The entire starting rotation except for Max Scherzer could be gone: Jacob deGrom, Chris Bassitt, Carlos Carrasco and Taijuan Walker. A large chunk of the bullpen, too: Edwin Díaz, Seth Lugo, Adam Ottavino and Trevor May. Nimmo may depart, too.

  </p>
  <p>As Cohen, Eppler, the Mets’ front office, Manager Buck Showalter, the coaching staff and perhaps the new team president sit down to dissect this season and why it ended earlier than expected, there is plenty that can improve despite amassing the most regular-season wins their last World Series-winning season in 1986.

  <h3>The Mets’ season had been unraveling down the stretch. They led their division, the N.L. East, for the entire season except six days, most of them at the end.</h3>

<h3>Was the Mets’ offense, more dependent on average and on-base percentage and less on power, the best way to build a lineup in this era of high velocity and movement? 

</h3>
<h3>With a small lead over the defending World Series champion Atlanta Braves at the time, should the Mets have done more at the Aug. 2 trade deadline to bolster the lineup and bullpen?</h3>

<h3>What about the rest of the rotation, bullpen and lineup? Will Cohen continue to spend at a record rate?</h3>

<blockquote>“It’s not just the losing; it’s the disbanding of the group because every single guy in this clubhouse is really awesome. It just sucks that you know it’s not going to be the same group next year.”</blockquote>

<p>Late into the night inside the Mets’ locker room after their Game 3 loss to San Diego that ended their season, players hugged, signed mementos for each other, stuffed their belongings into bags or boxes, shared a drink and said their goodbyes. This Mets team, as constructed, will never again be the same. With so many free agents, the Mets and their major-league-leading $288 million payroll will probably look very different next season.
<p>“It really hurts,” first baseman Pete Alonso said. “It’s not just the losing; it’s the disbanding of the group because every single guy in this clubhouse is really awesome. It just sucks that you know it’s not going to be the same group next year.”

</p>
<p>The Mets have been plagued by injuries over the last few years. But this year was an anomaly for most of their hitters.</p>

<p>Shortstop Francisco Lindor is a centerpiece of the Mets' future.</p>
<h3>So much could change, though, between now and spring training. So much already has about the Mets in between their most recent playoff appearances in 2016 and this season: a new owner, more spending, a beefed-up infrastructure, a new manager, improving stability as a franchise.

</h3>
<h3>Lindor said the team’s culture “is going to be one of the best in the game.” Asked what had changed since last year, he said there was “less noise from the outside” in the clubhouse and “it was expected to win day in and day out, and this wasn’t like a tryout, and you’re expected to be accountable.”
