        <p>I am a play-by-play commentator, sideline reporter, print journalist, public relations assistant and much more. Currently, I cover high school field hockey for The Washington Post, call play-by-play of many University of Maryland sports for live Big Ten Plus broadcasts, along with announcing high school football in the D.C. region for the NFHS Network. Over the summer, I was in the Midwest hosting shows on Bally Sports North and Bally Sports Wisconsin, along with sideline reporting on ESPN+ broadcasts. As I am beginning my senior year at Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism, I am looking for more opportunities all over the world of sports media.

        <h2>Experience</h2>               
        <h3>High School Sports Reporter></h3>               
        <h4>The Washington Post</h4>        
        <h5>Oct. 2021 - present</h5>
        <p>I’ve held the wrestling and field hockey beats, where I oversee coverage of more than 100 high school athletics programs in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia. This includes writing about most state, conference and national championship meets, determining team rankings throughout the season, curating “All-Met” teams afterward and writing feature stories every week. Last winter, I broke a story exposing a serious conflict between a coach and his administration over a girl wanting to wrestle that led to the coach’s resignation.
